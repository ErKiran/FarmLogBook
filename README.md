Multi Functional Farming App

### Problem Of Statement
_______________________________________________________________________
1. For the Farmers it's hard to keep track of their expenses and income of the particular crop.
2. Farmers has less options to choose betweens the crop to cultivate in their Land.
3. To help farmers increase their product with less fertilizers and pesticides.
4. To create Transpiracy in the crop that the consumers are consuming. For this We create Profile for Each of the Crop (But the profile is private By Default) If the Framers has decided to do e-commerce Stuff with us we can ask them to make their Crop Profile Public so that End User can Know what they are eating.

### What am I trying to solve? 
1. To keep track of the crop product so that we can visualize the income and expenditure on the certain crops.
2. Excessive Use of fertilizers and pesticides are not only harming the health of consumers and producers of the food product but also harming 
the environment and fertility of the Soil itself. I am thriving to make an effort to reduce use of such products and save the environment 
and check balance income and expenditure of the farmers.
3. The app will keep track of the environment(altitude,weather,climate,soil_type) where the crop have been cultivated. And according 
to the other people reports we will help people to best decide the crop that needed to be cultivated.
4. Farmers have habit to throw randomly pesticides and fertilizers and the shopkeepers has little knowledge about it. According to 
people who produce the most or best quality food product we can know the combo for the perfect product which can be both economical 
as well as environmental boost too.
